# X509 signature builder

`var x509 = require('js509').x509`

* `sign = x509.buildSignature(cert, hash, signature)`  
  Builds a signature from a certificate, a hash and a signature computed on the hash.  
  The `cert`, `hash` and `signature` parameters must be passed as buffers.  
  `cert` must be in X509 DER (binary) format.  
  Returns the signature object in X509 DER (binary) format, as a Buffer 
* `len = x509.guessSignatureSize(cert)`  
  Returns an estimated size for a signature for certifcate `cert`.  
  The returned length is always an overestimation. The caller may use it to 
  reserve an area where the signature will be copied later.
